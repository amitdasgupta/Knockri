How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
I used react because it helpes to write more logic in frontend, and hence development becomes less dependent on backend

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes as I went on creating components I realized that i am passing data from one components to another, So I can use context Api or redux here to improve performance and make code more readable.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would have used redux or context Api.
